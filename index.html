  <h1><i>Special Circumstances Day</i></h1>
  <h2>Celebrating the Genius of Iain (M.) Banks</h2>
</hgroup>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Becase Iain (M.) Banks is awesome! – We were all greatly saddened
by <a href="http://friends.banksophilia.com/">the news of his imminent
death,</a> and later – on June 9, 2013
– <a href="http://friends.banksophilia.com/28-2/">the even sadder news of his
actual death.</a> But rather than despair, let us all gather to celebrate a
tribute to this great man and his work.


<h2>When?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.iainbanksforum.net/showthread.php?796-Iain-(M.)-Banks-appreciation-day#post_message_18180">June
28 (a friday in 2013)</a> – This is the day on which two of the main storylines
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_on_Glass">Walking on Glass</a>
are set (in 1983). This day has some precedence, as it has been celebrated for
several years by a small number of people
(as <a href="http://www.iainbanksforum.net/showthread.php?513-Walking-Walking-on-Glass">Graham
Park Day</a>), by retracing the steps of Graham to Half Moon Crescent.


<h2>How?</h2>

<p>Exactly how should we celebrate this day?

<p>You could wear dark gray,
the <a href="http://zrajm.org/nerd/drone_colours.html">drone color</a> for
sorrow – maybe future Special Circumstances Days will warrant a different
color, but this first time around is definitely a time of sorrow for all of us.

<p>Or you could help us come up with some more eye-catching way of doing it.
(Post your ideas
in <a href="http://www.iainbanksforum.net/showthread.php?796-Iain-(M.)-Banks-appreciation-day">this
thread on Iain [M] Banks Fan Forum,</a> or on
our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/specialcircumstancesday">Facebook
page</a>.)

<p>If you want to inspiration for how to celebrate, some of the other
suggestions have been:

<ul>
  <li>The obvious: Carry around your favorite Iain (M.) Banks book
  <li>Carry a briefcase (drones are of briefcase size and shape)
  <li>Remove your neural net for the day
  <li>Wear that old T-shirt written
    in <a href="http://trevor-hopkins.com/banks/a-few-notes-on-marain.html">Marain</a>
  <li>Drunk and maudlin and throw up (the Scottish way, inspired by Crow Road
    and many other non-M books)
  <li>Wearing a UN badge or similar (envisioning/promoting the creation of a
    peaceful superpower)
  <li>Wearing nothing at all (since all the cool stuff in the books haven't
    been invented yet + The Culture have a very relaxed attitude about that
    kinda stuff)
  <li>Carry a chair around all day (Use of Weapons)
  <li>Binoculars, sunglasses, pony tail (again see Use of Weapons)
</ul>
